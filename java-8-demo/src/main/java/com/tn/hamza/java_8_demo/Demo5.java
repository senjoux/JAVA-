/**
 * <h1>Streams Characteristics</h1>
 * 
 * 1- <strong> Is purely an abstraction</strong> (unlike List, Set .. etc, so we
 * cannot point to a data in stream, simply it doesn't exist ) 
 * 
 * 2- <strong> Non mutating pipeline </strong> (transform from an operation to the 
 *    next, to the next .. without mutating any of the values/collections ),
 *    so !!! Carefully when changing something in a shared context such as streams context !!!
